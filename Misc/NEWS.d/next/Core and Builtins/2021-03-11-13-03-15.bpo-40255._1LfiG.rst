There is now internal support for "immortal" objects.  Those are objects
that will never be deleted, like the singletons and static types.  This has
benefits for the C-API and subinterpreters, as well as allowing for better
copy-on-write behavior for forking (if Py_IMMORTAL_CONST_REFCOUNTS is used).
The feature is currently intended for internal use, though you can try it
out by building with _Py_IMMORTAL_OBJECTS defined.
